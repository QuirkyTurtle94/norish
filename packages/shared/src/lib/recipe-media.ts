/**
 * The image a recipe leads with — one definition, everywhere.
 *
 * The gallery (`recipe_images`) is the source of truth: the first image by
 * order is the primary, and the legacy `recipes.image` scalar is only a
 * fallback for rows that predate the gallery. Every reader that shows a
 * recipe's picture resolves through this (the media carousel, the dashboard
 * projections, the realtime echo patch, the Dish Colour), and writers never
 * store a value in the scalar any more — the repository translates a payload
 * scalar into the gallery and clears the column on media-touching writes.
 * Only untouched legacy rows still carry one, which is why the fallback
 * stays until a migration retires the column.
 *
 * The repository's SQL projections mirror this rule as a correlated
 * subquery (`PRIMARY_IMAGE_SQL` in the recipes repository); a change here
 * must move with it.

/**
 * `order` stays loose because the zod contracts coerce it: callers hand this
 * whatever a form, an import, or a DTO carried, and it meets the payloads
 * where they are rather than demanding a parse first.
