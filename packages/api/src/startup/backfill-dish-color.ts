 *
 * Idempotent by shape: only rows with no colour are listed, a row with no
 * usable image is simply skipped (no image means no Dish Colour — that is
 * the defined outcome, not a failure), and a row whose extraction fails
 * stays null and is offered again next startup. Per-row failures never
 * stop the pass and the pass never stops the server.
